## Report Objective

<p style="font-size: 16px;"> This report aims to raise awareness about the tragic reality of child **deaths** caused **by diarrhoea** in **children under five**. Although **_preventable and treatable condition_**, it remains one of the **_leading causes of child mortality in many low-income countries_**, where access to healthcare is limited.

The narrative voice of this report is that of **Najir**, a **_4-year-old child who tells his story_**: from when he tells his mother he has a stomach ache, to when, despite efforts to find a cure, he sadly does not survive. Although this is a fictional story, it is plausible enough to reflect what happens in *countries with low access to diarrhoea care*, where the inadequacy of healthcare resources is tied to economic and social inequalities.

## Data Sources

The data used in this report comes from the following datasets:

1. **unicef_indicator_1.csv**: provides global data on the percentage of children under five with diarrhoea who can access healthcare facilities
2. **unicef_indicator_2.csv**: offers global data on the percentage of healthcare facilities with basic water access
3. **unicef_metadata.csv**: includes economic and social data
4. **deaths_caused_by_diarrhoea.csv**: provides data on diarrhoea-related child mortality categorized by seven regions. You can download it [here](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/diarrhoeal-disease/#data).

Please find the Tableau version of this report [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anthea.petrillo/viz/ThestoryofNajir_/Dashboard32).

## Najir's Story

![This is me](Najir.png)

**My name is Najir, and I am four years old.**

I do not feel well. A sharp pain grips my stomach, and my mother tells me I have diarrhoea. She holds my hand tightly, her face etched with worry, her eyes filled with silent fear. ***"We must find help,"*** she says. **However, seeking medical care is not a simple task.**


<p style="font-size: 16px;"> I live in one of the nineteen countries where, according to data collected **between 2017 and 2023**, among all the *children under the age of five suffering from diarrhoea*, **fewer than 40% have access** to _medical advice or treatment_ at a healthcare facility or from a trained provider.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_bar, labs, theme_minimal, theme, element_text, scale_fill_gradient

df = pd.read_excel("unicef_indicator_1_filtered_firstgraph.xlsx")

bar_chart = (
    ggplot(df, aes(x='country', y='access to care for diarrhoea', fill='access to care for diarrhoea')) 
    + geom_bar(stat='identity', show_legend=False, width=0.2)  
    + scale_fill_gradient(low='#D5006D', high='#FF80AB')

        y='Access to Care for Diarrhoea (%)'
    )

    + theme(
        axis_text_x=element_text(rotation=45, ha='right'),  
        figure_size=(10, 5), 
        plot_title=element_text(size=14, weight='bold'),

<p style="font-size: 16px;"> A serious public health crisis is evident: the *limited accessibility and availability of essential healthcare services* in specific areas of the world.

Despite being a preventable and treatable condition, **_diarrhoea remains one of the leading causes of child mortality_** in countries where healthcare systems are fragile.
According to the **_2021_** data, diarrhoea accounted for 9% of all deaths in children under 5 — over 1,200 daily, or 440,000 annually.

Mortality is highest in **_Sub-Saharan Africa_**.

    (df["unit_of_measure"] == "%")

<p style="font-size: 16px;"> Fortunately, my mother managed to find a healthcare facility and took me there.  
However, the <span style="color:#007BFF; font-weight:bold;">healthcare facilities with 
access to basic water services is not the same across the world</span>.  
The <span style="color:#17A2B8; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">lack of access to basic water services</span> means that healthcare facilities are <em>unable to treat children suffering from diarrhoea</em>.
